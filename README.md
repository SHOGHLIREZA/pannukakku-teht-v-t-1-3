# Pancake Project (JavaScript)

This is my practice project for the course. I completed the Pancake task from Phase 1 to Phase 3. In this project, I learned how to work with HTML forms, handle events using JavaScript, calculate total price dynamically, and store orders in localStorage.

> I got help from **ChatGPT** for **Phase 3** and part of **Phase 2** (showing the order summary).

The user can:
- Select a pancake type
- Choose toppings and extras
- Choose a delivery method
- See the total price live
- View an order summary
- Save the order in the browser (localStorage) – Phase 3

- Using `addEventListener` to handle form events
- Reading and updating DOM elements
- Working with array methods like `filter`, `map`, and `reduce`
- Using `localStorage` to store and retrieve data
- Reading user input and displaying it on the page

  used:

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript

For test it: Open the `index.html` file in your browser. Choose a pancake, toppings, and delivery method, then click the “See Order” button to view the summary.
